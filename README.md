# MoveDemos
Used this script with Windows Task Scheduler to move all .dem records from gameservers using SourceTV such as Counter Strike Source or CSGO to a directory where people could download the .dem file to check any gameplay or for admins to check a player's gameplay if suspected for cheating.

DirectoryLister was used to download the .dem files by gameserver with daily/monthly/yearly created directories.

You can download and install DirectoryLister from their official upload:
